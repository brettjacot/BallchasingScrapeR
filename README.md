### Ballchasing Scraper (R)
This project was a way for me to learn R by doing something I actually enjoy, so I created a basic package that allows for replays and groups on Ballchasing.com to be parsed for stats more easily (bear with me as this is the first time I've uploaded any sort of code to github, this may not be perfect).

This idea started from me coding the backbone of this package as a single program for Ontario Campus Carball's stats in Fall 2024, and by Winter 2025 I had used that code to create this package and the functions within it.

### Usage
This package can be downloaded to the user's rstudio by installing the `devtools` package and running the command `devtools::install_github('brettjacot/BallchasingScrapeR')`  workflow of this package is as follows:

1. get_replays_by_criteria() function to acquire a list of replay IDs based on the user-input criteria 
2. RunReplays() function with the results of get_replays_by_criteria() 
3. RankedStats() function with the results of RunReplays()

OR

stats_from_group() function to pull stats directly from an existing Ballchasing group

For this package to work, you will also need a Ballchasing API key, which can be generated by logging into ballchasing.com and going to https://ballchasing.com/upload.


### Credits
Thanks to CantFly for creating ballchasing.com, Colin Doyle for giving me an environment to explore this idea within Ontario Campus Carball, and Aditya Sapre for always answering my dumb questions while I figured all this out.
